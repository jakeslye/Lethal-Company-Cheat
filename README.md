# Lethal-Company-Cheat
## Info:
Seems like lots of people are making cheats for this game so I decided to release mine. This is my first proper unity cheat so its a little rough. I up for updating it so just LMK anything you want to see added. Also the menu is shitty so don't hate on me for it. Thanks to P1st (I stole his WorldToScreen function).

## Features:

### Self Cheats
1. Object, Player, Enemy ESP
2. Fast Climb - Climb ladders fast (useless feature tbh)
3. God Mode - not for things that instant kill
4. Super Jump - Lets you jump really really high
5. Infinite Sprint
6. Add XP - Add 100 xp. (I think this works. Idk how XP works in this game.)

### Other Player Cheats
1. Heal - Heal other players to 100 health
2. Kill
3. Spectate - Stuffs your camera in players head. (pretty buggy)
4. Teleport

### Server Cheats
1. Kill Everyone
2. End Game - Makes ship leave. (You have to wait until about 10 seconds after landing)
3. Heal Everyone - Heals a player as soon as they drop below 50 health.
4. Add 300 credits (to the terminal)
5. Heal Everyone
6. Log - A on screen log that tells you when people die
